# Ralph Progress Log - NicheSSP Salary Survey Interactive

Started: 2026-01-25

## Project Overview

Building an interactive salary data explorer for NicheSSP preconstruction recruitment.
109 US locations, 6 role levels, salary ranges + benefits data.

## Codebase Patterns

(To be populated as patterns are discovered)

## Key Files

- prd.json - 26 user stories defining the build
- prompt.md - Instructions for each iteration
- Source data: Google Sheet ID 1hGQOiGjhCZ56doiLtYxa5AC5XzcfikNpH23b8oK9pSU

## Data Notes

Salary data format in spreadsheet:
- Column B: Location (City, State)
- Column C: State code
- Columns H-S: Salary ranges by role (with change indicators)
- Columns T-W: Benefits (PTO, Bonus, Flex, ESOP)

Roles in order:
1. Director of Preconstruction (Column H)
2. Senior Preconstruction Manager (Column J)
3. Precon Manager (Column L)
4. Senior Estimator (Column N)
5. Estimator (Column P)
6. Junior Estimator (Column R)

Trend indicators: ↑ = up, ↓ = down, → = stable

## Brand Requirements

- NEVER say "recruitment" - use "our consultants"
- NEVER say "candidates" - use "preconstruction professionals"
- Brand colors: Navy #1a365d, Gold #d69e2e (verify against nichessp.com)

- Tailwind CSS 3.4.1 configured
- Dev server runs successfully
- Basic page renders correctly

**Learnings:**

- Global styles updated with brand color variables

**Key files modified:**
- tailwind.config.ts - Added navy/gold color palettes and Inter font family

- src/types/salary.ts - TypeScript types (Location, SalaryRange, Benefits, Roles, Trend, RoleKey)
- src/lib/salaries.ts - Typed export of salary data

**Data structure:**
```typescript
interface Location {
  city: string;
  state: string;

    }
  };
  benefits: {

    bonusPercent: { min: number; max: number } | null;
    flexPercent: number | null;
    esopPercent: number | null;
  };
}
```

**Learnings:**
